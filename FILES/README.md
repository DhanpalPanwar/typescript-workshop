# TypeScript Training #1: Fundamentals

This repository contains a bare React and TypeScript setup, using vite for bundling.

We can ignore the specifics of the underlying TypeScript setup in the interests of getting stuck into the language itself.

The following JavaScript files are examples of functions that use primitive types:

`./src/javascript/*.js`

By 'primitive type' we mean built in fundamental types inherent to any type system, e.g.:

- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`
- `null`
- `any`
- `unknown`
- `never`

We'll also cover some types that are not strictly primitive, but data structures that can contain primitives:

- `array`
- `object`

The goal is to rewrite these JavaScript functions in TypeScript by the end of this workshop.

See some examples in the `./src/examples` folder.
